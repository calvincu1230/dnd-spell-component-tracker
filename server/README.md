# dnd-spell-component-tracker

Honestly, something to track spell components would be super cool but that's probably a ton of legwork. It would require reading their DNDbeyond spell list or spells available at their level by class, and then cross-referencing their 
inventory. I'm picturing a reply that shows spell and components needed with a check mark to signify having it and an x to signify not having it, and maybe a 3rd option to signify an arcane focus used in place of the component.


There are two things an arcane focus can't replace. It can't replace components that have a cost. And it cant replace components that are consumed. So it doesn't need both of those criteria to not be replaced, it's a check that if it
meets either of those criteria it can't be replaced.

|      Spell      |    Component    | Pass/Fail |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| Shield of Faith | paper/holy text |     âœ…     |


IDEA:
    Have a section of all detected custom item costs
    Display focus there too
